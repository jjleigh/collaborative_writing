He didn't know why they were there... but they were.

They noticed that he was there, and started the questions. He didnt want to be noticed so he hid in a banana peel and ate dill flavored ruby gems.

After eating the gems, he turned the banana peel into a spaceship and blasted to mars. When he got to Mars he decided he wanted to make joffry lanister cry and so he went back in time.

He arrived just before Marty started to drive and stole the Delorian, he put the pedal to the metal and at 88mph he was transported to the time of Joffry Lanister. 

He put in the wrong coordinates and ended up in the middle of the cold war, with his dill flavoured ruby gems.

He was so far back in time that he wasn't able to update the gems and so they became invaluable to him. He just sat in the car crying like Mark Walberhg in the end of "Mist".

Then he thought of the mist, that sweet cool, crisp mist rolling over the cusp of the andean mountiains. and he said if only i could sleep there forever and drink the water from the gobi desert.
