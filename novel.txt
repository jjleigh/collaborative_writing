He didn't know why they were there... but they were.

They noticed that he was there, and started the questions. He didnt want to be noticed so he hid in a banana peel and ate dill flavored ruby gems.

After eating the gems, he turned the banana peel into a spaceship and blasted to mars. When he got to Mars he decided he wanted to make joffry lanister cry and so he went back in time.

He arrived just before Marty started to drive and stole the Delorian, he put the pedal to the metal and at 88mph he was transported to the time of Joffry Lanister. 

He put in the wrong coordinates and ended up in the middle of the cold war, with his dill flavoured ruby gems.
